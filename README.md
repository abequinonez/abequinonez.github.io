# Portfolio Site

My most up-to-date portfolio site. Originally developed as a project for the Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program. The site was built using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. Additional resources include jQuery (required for the Bootstrap navbar), Picturefill (responsive image polyfill for browsers without picture element support), and Font Awesome (social media icons).

You can view the site [here](https://abequinonez.github.io).
